            <p>I chose this image to represent the entrepreneurial journey I am currently on. I have been putting pieces together
                to start my own courier/delivery service in the DMV area. I have been working on this idea for a few years now and
                I am finally at a point where I can see it coming to fruition. This image represents the hard work and dedication
                that is required to start a business. The courier in the image is represents strength, doing the work that is necessary
                to make the business successful. This image is a reminder to me that I need to stay focused and keep pushing forward
                even when things get tough. The courier is also a reminder that I need to be willing to get my hands dirty and do
                whatever it takes to make my business successful. Overall, this image is a great representation of the entrepreneurial
                journey I am on and the hard work that is required to make my dreams a reality.
