            <p>I chose this image of Lamar Jackson to represent the love I have for the sports teams in my city. If its not purple and black
                or orange and black (Baltimore Orioles) I don't watch it. I have been a Ravens fan since they came into the league in 1996
                and have been alive to see every championship they have won. I love the city of Baltimore and the surrounding areas
                and I love to see the city come together to support the team. It's one of the few things that can bring the city together.
                This season isn't one for the books, but I am hopeful that the team can turn it around and make a run for the playoffs.
