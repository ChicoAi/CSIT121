      <h2>My first webpage!</h2>
      <p>At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many tags and structures to remember, but
        breaking it down step by step made it manageable. Learning how to properly structure an
        HTML helped me understand how webpages are built and displayed.

    <div class="grid-item" id="reflection-1">
      <h2>Reflection 1</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Structure of a webpage</li>
        <li>File naming and paths</li>
        <li>HTML elements</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Learning about the structure of a webpage, file naming and paths, and HTML elements was another
        exciting step. I learned a lot from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block and Inline Elements</li>
        <li>The Description List Elements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grid-item" id="reflection-2">
      <h2>Reflection 2</h2>
      <p class="special">What I have learned in this lab was how CSS controls the appearance of a webpage.
        Like the notes were explaining, HTML is the skeleton of a webpage, CSS is you dressing up the skeleton
        to make it look "fly". The borders made my page appear more professional and structured.
        I was also able to create a theme around my webpage. I feel like this would be crucial for 
        brands and businesses to maintain a consistent look and feel across their online presence. My challenge that I faced here
        was keeping track of which selector was controlling which element. But after some trial and error, I was able to
        figure it out.

    <div class="grid-item" id="reflection-3">
      <h2>Reflection 3</h2>
      <p class="special">For this lab, I learned about responsive designs and how to implement them using CSS. 
        I gained knowledge on flexbox and grid layouts which made my webpage adapt to different screen sizes. 
        I also familiarized myself with the developer tools in browsers to test responsiveness without having to 
        use multiple devices. This lab took my comfortability with CSS to a new level and I am getting more comfortable with CSS as I practice. 
        One question I have is when making multiple webpages, would it be best for developers to have a code for sizing 
        and responsiveness that they reuse across all their projects, or should it be tailored for each individual project? 
        The resources I used to help me understand responsive design were:
