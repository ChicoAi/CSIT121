    <h3>My first webpage!</h3>
    <p>At first, the process seemed daunting, with so many tags and structures to remember, 
        but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. 
        Learning how to properly structure an HTML helped me understand how webpages
    are built and displayed.</p>

        Learning about the structure of a webpage, file naming and paths,
        and HTML elements was another exciting step. I learned a lot from:

    <h4>Reflection 2</h4>
        <p>Learning about the basics of CSS is has made creating my very first webpage even more exciting! 
            I went from a plain white background with black text (boring), 
            to creating an Orioles themed color webpage to honor my hometown baseball team.
         In addition to added my own creative look to my webpage. One of the biggest takeaway
        I got from this module was structuring the stylesheet in a way that looked clean and easy to understand. 
    Specifically making notes for each section highlighting what is being implemented.
    This makes it so collaborators will know what I am executing and can add on to it with no problem.
I have also added the feedback from my professor in this lab as well. 
Adding in my structure tags to my code. </p>
