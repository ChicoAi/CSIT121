            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Mike, born and raised in Baltimore. I figured out most rappers are broke so instead of pursuing that career, i decided to be a college student pursuing a degree in computer science because that's where a stable future is at. I'm not a fan of small talk, so this section won't be too long.
                I give out knuckle sandwhiches to elementary school kids during the day and my favorite food is sushi.
